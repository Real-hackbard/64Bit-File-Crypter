There is no such thing as a 64-bit file in the strict sense, as the bit width does not refer to an individual file, but rather to the processor architecture and operating system for which a file was compiled or optimized. A "64-bit file" is therefore usually a program file specifically developed for a 64-bit system.

What is a 64-bit system?
A 64-bit system is based on an architecture that can process data in 64-bit blocks. The main advantage of this technology is the ability to utilize significantly more RAM than a 32-bit system. While 32-bit systems are limited to approximately 4 gigabytes (GB) of RAM, 64-bit systems can theoretically address a much larger amount of RAM.

Characteristics of a 64-bit application:
Programs compiled for a 64-bit system have the following characteristics:
* Improved performance: By accessing more memory and using larger registers, 64-bit applications can process larger amounts of data more efficiently. This is particularly beneficial for resource-intensive tasks such as video editing, data analysis, or computer games.
* File size: 64-bit executable files are typically larger than their 32-bit counterparts because they contain longer address values.
* Compatibility: 64-bit programs can only run on a 64-bit operating system. However, modern 64-bit operating systems are usually backward compatible and can run older 32-bit applications.
* Memory management: 64-bit programs can handle file sizes that exceed the 4 GB limit of 32-bit architectures.
