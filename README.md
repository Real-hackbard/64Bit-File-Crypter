There is no such thing as a 64-bit file in the strict sense, as the bit width does not refer to an individual file, but rather to the processor architecture and operating system for which a file was compiled or optimized. A "64-bit file" is therefore usually a program file specifically developed for a 64-bit system.

What is a 64-bit system?
A 64-bit system is based on an architecture that can process data in 64-bit blocks. The main advantage of this technology is the ability to utilize significantly more RAM than a 32-bit system. While 32-bit systems are limited to approximately 4 gigabytes (GB) of RAM, 64-bit systems can theoretically address a much larger amount of RAM.

Characteristics of a 64-bit application:
Programs compiled for a 64-bit system have the following characteristics:
* Improved performance: By accessing more memory and using larger registers, 64-bit applications can process larger amounts of data more efficiently. This is particularly beneficial for resource-intensive tasks such as video editing, data analysis, or computer games.
* File size: 64-bit executable files are typically larger than their 32-bit counterparts because they contain longer address values.
* Compatibility: 64-bit programs can only run on a 64-bit operating system. However, modern 64-bit operating systems are usually backward compatible and can run older 32-bit applications.
* Memory management: 64-bit programs can handle file sizes that exceed the 4 GB limit of 32-bit architectures.

In [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture), 64-bit integers, [memory addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address), or other data units[a] are those that are 64 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) wide. Also, 64-bit [central processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) units (CPU) and arithmetic logic units (ALU) are those that are based on [processor registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register), [address buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)#Address_bus), or data buses of that size. A computer that uses such a processor is a 64-bit computer.

From the software perspective, 64-bit computing means the use of [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) with 64-bit virtual memory addresses. However, not all 64-bit instruction sets support full 64-bit virtual memory addresses; [x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) and [AArch64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64), for example, support only 48 bits of virtual address, with the remaining 16 bits of the virtual address required to be all zeros (000...) or all ones (111...), and several 64-bit instruction sets support fewer than 64 bits of physical memory address.

A 64-bit word can be expressed as a sequence of 16 hexadecimal digits.
